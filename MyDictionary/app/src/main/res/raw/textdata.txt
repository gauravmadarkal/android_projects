Jacob drew steel the sound echoing through the tavern and drawing every pair of eyes Zanes face went stony for a moment but then avalanched into laughter and mirth You would kill me then monk spat Zane You must have forgotten your own book Thou shalt not kill Im not xlinx afraid of your threats The drunken brawler suddenly pulled two long knives from his belt twirling them like ballerinas Im going to kill you now and take that book from you Ought to be worth something to somebody Zane leaped forward and Jacobs sword flashed in the torchlight A split second later Zanes blades clanged against the far walls But Jacob did not stop at disarming his opponent he was too deadly too proud No Jacobs weapon swung through the air the razor tip scraping Zanes neck slitting it The metal monk knelt beside his dying opponent Quietly he prayed over the man begging his Lord to forgive him his sins and wing this soul to heaven When he was done he caught a last flicker of light in Zanes eyes He whispered If you had been more familiar with my book you might have known another verse I come not to bring peace but a sword I did not seek a fight with you But I am through running
